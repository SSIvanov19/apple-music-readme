<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I came across multiple projects which displayed your recently songs on your GitHub readme but found none for Apple Music. Since the Apple Music API kit is paid, I found an easy hack to get the recently added albums to Apple Music library **for free**.

If you want to use this project, just follow the steps below
